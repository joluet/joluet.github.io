   summarypoints:
    - WunderCar is a very young startup that was founded in the beginning of 2014. The WunderCar app wants to enable people in big cities to share their cars and socialize. The concept is comparable to Lyft or Uber from the US. </br>Together with an other senior developer I developed the WunderCar Android app. We took over a small code base that was developed by an outsourcing company, refactored it and continued the implementation.
